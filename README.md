# Simple Applications of Constraint Programming using Choco Solver (Java)

Constraint programming (CP) is a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, and operations research. In constraint programming, users declaratively state the constraints on the feasible solutions for a set of decision variables. Constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found


## Getting Started
In the following examples, I'll use Choco solver. It's a Free Open-Source Java library dedicated to Constraint Programming, to solve some famous combinatorial problems:


    -SUDOKU
    
    -QUEEN
    
    -COLORING GRAPHS

### Prerequisites

In order to use Choco Solver, all what you have to do , is adding choco lib to the JRE system library.
   
   For Eclipse users:
```
File --> New --> Java Project -->(name/ JRE: JavaSE-1.6) --> Next -->libraries -->Add External JARs--> choco-y.xxxxx.jar
```
