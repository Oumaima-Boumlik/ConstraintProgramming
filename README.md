# Simple Applications of Constraint Programming using Choco Solver (Java)

 Constraint programming (CP) is a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, and operations research. In constraint programming, users declaratively state the constraints on the feasible solutions for a set of decision variables. Constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found.

### Prerequisites

In order to use Choco Solver, all what you have to do , is adding choco lib to the JRE system library.
   
   For Eclipse users:
```
File --> New --> Java Project -->(name/ JRE: JavaSE-1.6) --> Next -->libraries -->Add External JARs--> choco-y.xxxxx.jar
```

## Getting Started
In the following examples, I'll use Choco solver. It's a Free Open-Source Java library dedicated to Constraint Programming, to solve some famous combinatorial problems:

     -Graph Coloring problem is to assign colors to certain elements of a graph subject to certain constraints.It has huge number of applications:
      --> Making Schedule or Time Table.         
      --> Map Coloring.
      --> Mobile Radio Frequency Assignment.                            
      --> Sudoku.   
      
    -SUDOKU:The objective is to fill a n*n grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
    
    -QUEEN:The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
